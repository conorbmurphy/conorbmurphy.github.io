			<title>The World of Hippy Science</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, thanks for the feedback on the newsletter.  The people have spoken: longer form writing is preferred over mega-dense bullets.  So here goes nothing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to make an investment into a cannabis-focused public benefit corporation (think part company, part nonprofit).  So I figured it was a good chance to talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly of cannabis.  Yes, cannabis.  Whose research used to be dismissed as “hippy science” but whose benefits and drawbacks are now a lot better understood.  So here we’ll exchange our flower leis and bongos for lab coats and clipboards to dive into that strange world of the hippy science of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off: cannabis 101.  The plant has been used medicinally and recreationally for at least 5,000 years.  Cannabis targets the body’s so-called “endocannabinoid system” which is responsible for many things.  Like, a crazy number of things.  Many of its functions are autoregulatory where it helps the brain and body maintain homeostasis.  Medically, cannabis has been FDA approved for the treatment of epilepsy and  it also has well-studied effects including for anti-inflamatory, anti-anxiety, anti-psychotic, and pain reduction applications, to name a few.  Evolutionarily, you can trace the endocannabinoid system back as far as sea-squirts.  Yes, these guys whose earliest shared common ancestor with humans is around 550 million years ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sea-squirt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sea Squirts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that to say, the endocannabinoid system is really important.  And there are two main components to the cannabis plant that affect this system: THC and CBD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THC is basically the only psychoactive compound in the plant.  That’s fancy talk for it being responsible for finding cartoons funny, sudden cravings for ice cream, and giving peace a chance, man.  Its effects are “biphasic,” meaning that at low doses THC can have positive effects like euphoria and relaxation while at high levels it can cause anxiety and paranoia.  One fun fact: while THC is often used to combat anxiety, chronic use actually results in consistently higher stress hormones and a lower capacity for emotional self-regulation.  Ok, so that’s the good, bad, and ugly of THC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CBD is arguably a much more interesting compound.  Well, family of compounds actually.  Though technically THC is a family of compounds too.  It’s complex.  There are over 500 known compounds in the cannabis plant.  We’re really just scratching the surface here.  But I digress…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While THC takes the body out of homeostasis, CBD often returns the body to homeostasis.  For instance, CBD has been shown to enhance “fear extinction,” or the extinction of conditioned fear responses.  That means there’s pre-clinical evidence for endocannabinoid-related clinical PTSD applications (trauma is about as far as you can get from homeostatic balance).  And as for safety?  CBD generally has a pretty solid safety profile.  Hell, the FDA approved one compound for epileptic children starting at 1 year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s more.  A lot more.  CBD use has exploded in recent years due to three main applications: stress, pain, and sleep.  Personally, I believe that CBD is the best, non-habit forming substance you can take to combat the epidemic of stress.  Other solutions (think Valium) are effective but also highly addictive.  As the baby boomers age, non-opioid pain management becomes increasingly important (my grandma at 96 years young is a daily user).  And finally, CBD use for sleep has grown immensely with research evidence supporting its efficacy as an alternative to other supplements like melatonin, which has fallen out of favor recently as it helps you fall asleep but not stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this informed my decision to take a private equity stake in a public benefit corporation that has a consumer CBD line &lt;a href=&quot;https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Ojai+Energetics+Pbc&amp;amp;oq=Ojai+Energetics+Pbc&quot;&gt;as well as an impressive patent portfolio&lt;/a&gt; and many cool strategic plays up their sleeves.  This company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ojaienergetics.com/&quot;&gt;Ojai Energetics&lt;/a&gt;, has many advantages that separate it from alternatives including water solubility that increases the body’s absorption since most CBD users take way too little (I’m looking at you Venice, CA cafés with your weak CBD lattes).  Also, they publish all their lab reports so you can verify exactly what’s in the bottle.  This is incredibly important as the FDA doesn’t regulate supplements and all those CBD pop-up shops in strip malls don’t really inspire trust, if you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the good, the bad, and the ugly of cannabis.  It checks the box for clinical applications as well as broader consumer efficacy for that trifecta of stress, pain, and sleep.  And a lot more to come than just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned…
Conor&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>AI, Stress and Information Juggernauts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking at all the holiday cards I received from family and friends this year thinking “man, I love staying in touch with people but don’t have a cute kid. Hell, I don’t even have an ugly one.”  One might not normally think of fun discoveries in neuroscience and artificial intelligence as “cute,” but they’re what fire me up most so I figured it’s as good an excuse as any to keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, the geeky shit I’ve been loving since my last newsletter…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring neural networks.&lt;/strong&gt;  Since I don’t have a kid but like hiking and math, here’s my version of a family Christmas card.  These images walk through the inner mechanics of a neural network, visualizing what different components of the network are doing in a complex algorithm.  Deep neural networks combine layers of artificial “neurons” that apply transformations to data. It starts with our input data. In our case, it’s a bunch of numerical values representing pixels in an image. The network takes that input and passes it through a series of layers where the output from the previous layer is the input to the next layer (roughly). Each layer transforms its inputs using what it has learned about the dataset so far. After going through many of these layers, it becomes possible to identify complex objects.  You can see how earlier layers are identifying basic strokes and shading while later layers are showing, well, a lot of animal faces.  That’s because this network was originally trained on a bunch of animal images.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://conorbmurphy.com/2021/01/13/Exploring-Neural-Networks.html&quot;&gt;Here’s a bit more detail if you’re interested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/couple_image_combined_compressed.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Visualizing NNs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flipping stress upside down.&lt;/strong&gt;  Is stress bad?  Well, it depends.  Normally we think of stress as bad, and this has been the prevailing logic for decades.  One study changed this. It took about 30k participants and observed them over 8 years in order to see how their stress &lt;em&gt;and their perception of stress&lt;/em&gt; affected their risk of premature death. The findings? Having high stress and a perception that stress is unhealthy &lt;em&gt;combined&lt;/em&gt; was associated with a 43% increase in premature death. However, those with high stress and the belief that stress was healthy had lower mortality rates than those with low stress! This points to the idea that mindset really matters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22201278/&quot;&gt;The researchers go so far as to claim&lt;/a&gt; that the mindset that stress in unhealthy is associated with 20k US deaths a year, the 15th highest cause of death above both AIDs and homicide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of AI.&lt;/strong&gt; The artificial intelligence research organization OpenAI released a new pretrained model known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3&quot;&gt;GPT-3&lt;/a&gt;.  Pretrained models allow you to reuse the findings of one AI model on new use cases.  This one absolutely dwarfs the complexity of previous models.  It’s a natural language model used to generate human-like text.  It cost an estimated $10M for the compute resources to train it alone.  Here’s a comparison of the complexity of this new model when compared to other state-of-the-art models as quantified by the number of “parameters,” which is basically the individual units of information the model is learning.  For the full geeky rundown, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZUimafgXCBSLsgbacd6-a-dqO7yLyzIl1ZJbiCBUUT4/edit#slide=id.g557254d430_0_0&quot;&gt;see this State of AI Report.&lt;/a&gt; This means anybody can use reuse this best-in-class natural language producing algorithm without racking up a $10M bill. It’s truly mind-boggling how open sourcing this type of solution advances industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/state-of-ai.png&quot; alt=&quot;State of AI&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High impact career.&lt;/strong&gt;  You have 80k hours in your career. How do you use them to have the most impact? That’s the idea behind &lt;a href=&quot;80k Hours&quot;&gt;the startup 80k Hours.&lt;/a&gt; It’s career guidance that optimizes for impact. Should you create a startup that addresses the world’s toughest problems? Or make a bunch of money at a corporation and donate it? I’ve used this site many times in my career to work through these ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being an information juggernaut.&lt;/strong&gt;  The firehose of information we receive each day is somewhere around 174 newspapers worth a day.  Oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/8316534/Welcome-to-the-information-age-174-newspapers-a-day.html&quot;&gt;that study&lt;/a&gt; was from a decade ago.  Compare that with just 2.5 pages worth back in 1986.  So how do you navigate so much information?  My favorite strategy has a few tenants:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Prioritize books because they have the greatest density of information (think of how long a blogger takes to write an article when compared with a book)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Your attention is one of the most important things in the world since all your experience is really just the summation of things you paid attention to.  Make sure the author earns that attention. Be an unapologetic skimmer&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Take note of every book that’s recommended to you and at least read the summary.  If the summary entices you, read the table of contents.  And if that earns more of your time, read a few pages of the introduction&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Still not sure if it’s worth the read?  Try a service &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blinkist.com/&quot;&gt;like Blinkist&lt;/a&gt; that gives you a TED-talk length, 15 minute summary of the book.  Then decide whether it’s worth the time&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s a wrap! Hope this didn’t suck. Be sure to let me know what you think about the topics and format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conor&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Exploring Neural Networks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is an exploration into the inner mechanics of neural networks. Each image in this series emphasizes a different layer in the network, showing how different components come together in a complex algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/couple_image_combined.gif&quot; alt=&quot;sleeping brain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, a primer…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks combine layers of artificial “neurons” that apply transformations to data. It starts with our input data. In our case, it’s a bunch of numerical values representing pixels in an image. The network takes that input and passes it through a series of layers where the output from the previous layer is the input to the next layer (roughly). Each layer transforms its inputs using what it has learned about the dataset so far. After going through many of these layers, it becomes possible to identify complex objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process works similarly to human vision where there are a number of progressive layers of neurons. Each layer enhances the signal it receives by interpreting increasingly complex objects. In both artificial and biological neural networks, earlier layers will identify basic patterns like edges of objects and shading while later layers identify more complex patterns like an eye or leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These images were generated by emphasizing the influence of particular layers. They are in progressive order moving from earlier to later layers. The original image is at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how enhancing the first couple layers results in strokes and other basic patterns. This is because they have learned basic edges and their orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With higher level layers, we see more complex (and sometimes downright strange) effects. Since the model was originally trained on an image dataset with many animals, you’ll see eyes and the faces of dogs.  In one layer, you also see my chest covered with dog fur and a dog face. In the final layers, you see far fewer distortions as those layers have learned more complex objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a complex process and I glossed over many of the details. But that’s the gist of how human and computer vision operates. In brief: information is processed in a hierarchical manner where low level inputs are gradually abstracted into more complex representations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CJzekb2jup4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&quot;&gt;See this link to walk through the images in more detail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>A First Newsletter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Insert the obligatory “this year was a doozy” comment. I set up an email collector some time back and imagine my surprise when I checked the sign-ups this morning to find far more interest in a newsletter than I thought. Given all the change this year, I wanted to double down on keeping in contact with my network with some tips and curiosities from the world of brain science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promise to keep it brief, practical, and sufficiently strange to give you a couple of dopamine squirts and a smidgeon of awe for the complexity of the brain. Oh, and no marketing unless it’s something that’s been a true force multiplier in my life. If you’re not down, feel free to unsubscribe. No hard feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, here’s a few musings from 2020:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coolest image.&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, this one is actually from late 2019. But bear with me. When you sleep, three sets of rhythmic waves can be seen in the brain. It’s been known that distinct patterns of electrical activity take place in the brain while sleeping. &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6465/628&quot;&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that this electrical activity is coupled with changes in blood flow (in red below) and cerebrospinal fluid (in blue). The reason? Unknown, but it likely has to do with memory consolidation and clearing cellular waste. So instead of counting sheep when you can’t sleep, just think about the coordinated waves of fluids lapping the cradle of your consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sleeping-brain.gif&quot; alt=&quot;sleeping brain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biggest breakthrough.&lt;/strong&gt; My high school biology teacher used to say “you’re just a bag of chemical reactions.” I thought it was hyperbole…but it’s not. DNA is the blueprint for constructing proteins, which are the most abundant molecules in living systems. When new proteins are created, they fold into a 3 dimensional shape that determines what the protein does. The protein folding problem is a “grand challenge” of immense implications because it is incredibly hard to predict what shape a protein will take and therefore what it will do. In 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology&quot;&gt;a Google team released AlphaFold,&lt;/a&gt; which is an artificial intelligence-based solution to solve this problem. Is it solved? Largely, but not fully since there are many edge cases and environmental factors. But this is a huge step forward in understanding the mechanism of DNA.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On creative minds.&lt;/strong&gt; Every so often your favorite minds team up on a project that makes you feel like you’re watching a neuroscience version of the A-Team or Avengers…or something (I don’t know, I actually haven’t watched those movies). Anyways, one dominant theory for expertise is the “neural efficiency” hypothesis where high performers undergo more efficient neurological processes when compared to their “non-eminent” peers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920304973&quot;&gt;One 2020 study&lt;/a&gt; looked at this effect in eminent and non-eminent thinkers. It confirmed this hypothesis in the “default mode network,” which is also known as the mind-wandering or imagination network, where eminent thinkers show less activity. This network can be thought of as having two branches: one is rumination (think negative self talk) while the other is creative (think the ah-ha moment in the shower). Maybe that helps explain why creatives are also often dark souls. It’s another layer deeper into the mechanism of creativity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/creative-brain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;creative brain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book I’m most excited about.&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, this one might be marketing-y but I swear it passes my filter as a force multiplier in my life. I read an advanced copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theartofimpossible.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Kotler’s Art of Impossible&lt;/a&gt; and absolutely loved it. It’s a guide for motivation, learning, and creativity that is both theoretically rigorous and deeply practical. It’ll be released later this month but if you pre-order a copy now there is some added content for goal setting, managing distractions, etc. Seriously. Can’t recommend it highly enough. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theartofimpossible.com/&quot;&gt;Preorder here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal setting strategies.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve long struggled with the best goal setting strategies. I’ve gone from spreadsheets tracking 100 or so daily habits to vague intentions set one New Years Eve and only recalled the following December 31st. My new favorite strategy is three-fold:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflect.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a single sheet of paper, divide it into 12 quadrants, and label each with a month from the past year. Use only bullet points of the most memorable parts (highlights and lowlights). Mark the really important ones.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name.&lt;/strong&gt; Each year gets a theme based on how to double down on making the highlights from the past year a more central part of the following year. Name your year something succinct.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Take another single sheet of paper. There are two sections. The first defines a mission, a goal, and the waypoints. The mission is a high level intention for your entire life such as “Advance society’s transition to a technological utopia.” The more idealist the better. The goal is a concrete application of that such as “Create a biotechnology company with $100M annual revenue that solves…” The waypoints are high level milestones in that process. The second section is four boxes with goals at different timepoints: lifetime, 10 year, 1 year, and 90 days (shout-out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maxhug.com/&quot;&gt;Max Hug&lt;/a&gt; for this format). You only get a maximum of 5 goals in each box. Frame it. Keep it on your desk.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best change management song.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe change is the theme of every year but it was especially true of 2020. Best beats for embracing change? &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1XYGVM8TsjeadnoNG4ZKbh?si=Aq6Ibu36S06UIIDXSJ7JqA&quot;&gt;New Morning has been my go-to for the last 1.5 years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s a wrap! Hope this was fun and informative. I’ll try to do this more often, though probably a bit shorter. And please please please, let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wishing you all the best in the new year,
Conor&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Towards a Gay Science</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In the vast stream of information I’ve ingested over the course of my life, the writings of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche have been consistent anchor points.  Reading Nietzsche for me—in his complexity, irreverence, and joyfulness—feels like remembering, like a homecoming. Many of my privileged memories from adolescence involve reading his books outside by a fire.  These ideas propelled me through multiple degrees in philosophy, helped me navigate life’s challenges with integrity, and balanced seriousness with playfulness in a seemingly contradictory way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the academic tradition of philosophy because I found that it couldn’t balance this seriousness with playfulness.  Philosophy, for me, had become academic.  I saw philosophy in universities become a game of allegiances and tenure, another example of mistaking the map for the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoreau once claimed that there are no longer any philosophers, only philosophy professors.  I knew of this quote from an early age, but it wasn’t until I was in grad school that I finally admitted that he was correct.  The tradition became serious.  And so I left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I left the university halls of academia, I never lost track of the Nietzschean project.  Instead, it began to take on new forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flow is a state of consciousness characterized by full absorption in the present.  It’s the key to performance, as we perform at our best in flow.  It also answers the existential question: what meaning does my life have?  As Kafka once said that “the meaning of life is that it ends,” in some weird recursive way, I’ve come to feel that the meaning of life is to live life.  The more time you spend in the present—rather than ruminating about the past or anxious about the future—the more meaningful life becomes.  Flow is, after all, really just deep presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could make the connection between flow and Nietzsche in any number of ways.  The most interesting for me is by way of a larger question: why do we care about philosophy, science, or truth anyways?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Gay Science&lt;/em&gt;, Nietzsche wrote the following: “what was at stake in all philosophizing hitherto was not at all ‘truth’ but rather something else—let us say health, future, growth, power, life…”  Nietzsche’s project departs from the conventional sense of truth.  It’s not about understanding the external world with certainty.  It’s not about mapping a universal and unchanging essence behind fleeting appearances.  For him, the desire for certainty is a mark of sickness.  The project is to make science gay in the sense of orienting it towards health and playfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the science of flow comes in.  Nietzsche’s project can be seen as what he calls the will to power, or a self-overcoming force.  He never defines this force concretely, likely to leave it open to the interpretation of the reader.  Flow science as the science of human performance has inherited Nietzsche’s project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flow became the latest incarnation of this project I inherited from Nietzsche.  It’s another term for the theme of health, vitality, and flourishing.  But using the more technical term flow has made this idea so much more actionable.  It allows me to talk about a state that is, after all, knowable and programmable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we know about flow is that if I change different inputs, I get more flow.  For instance, the challenge/skill balance is the so-called “golden rule” of flow.  If the challenge of the task at hand is a bit above my current skill level, I’m more likely to drop into flow.  Too much challenge and I’m overwhelmed; too little and I’m bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this means that I’m programmable: I can change my actions and get different results.  Not only am I programmable, but it is I who can do the programming.  This is the heart of a gay science. It’s a unification of theory and practice all for this larger goal: the will to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipped with these ideas, I made many changes in my life.  I’ve skydived hundreds of times because danger is a flow trigger so action sports athletes find more flow than anybody else.  I now work in technology since the immediate feedback loops of programming and the fast-paced cadence of startups mean more flow.  I also volunteer early mornings and weekends doing research on flow and neuroscience.  I do this because working as a technologist has shown me that the limiting factor in building great things is how well we understand underlying mechanism.  More knowledge means more flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve found in this process is that there are many people like me.  Many people have struggled with making meaning in their lives, stumbled across flow (whether they use the term or not), and are willing to take risks and undergo drastic changes to orient their lives around the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I receive many emails each week showing interest in understanding the state, lending a hand on the research, or trying to build companies or new communities around flow.  Take a step back to examine what that means: people are willing to volunteer their time free of charge for this state.  It’s paradoxical.  It defies the logic of humans as pleasure-seeking animals who are stumbling around the planet avoiding pain and looking for a good party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has led me to be a lot more public with some of the things I’ve been working on.  This blog is an attempt to capture that.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/514216-admit-it-you-aren-t-like-them-you-re-not-even-close&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In the words of one luminary&lt;/a&gt;, whether you love him or hate him: “Find the others…”&lt;/p&gt;
