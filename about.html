        Conor lives at the intersection of data science and optimal
        psychology, using data and technology to understand and reinforce
        the best parts of human experience. His training is in neuroscience,
				artificial intelligence, and philosophy. He transitioned to the tech
        sector after spending four years leveraging data for more impactful
        humanitarian interventions in developing countries. Since then. he
        has held a variety of positions including a faculty role for University of
        New Haven and Galvanize's Master of Science in Data Science
        program, principal data scientist and consultant for a number of
        startups and a lead data scientist and educator for machine learning and
        artificial intelligence at Databricks. Outside of data, Conor is an avid
        skydiver, getting into the sport after reading about the intersection of
        action sports and flow states in books like Steven Kotler's <i>The Rise of
        Superman</i> and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's <i>Flow</i>.</p>
